    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Nick Fato and I am currently a Sophomore at the University of South Carolina. I am from Baltimore, Maryland and am pursuring an Environmental Science major. I enjoy playing soccer, playing basketball, fishing, and spending time with my friends and family. When I am not in class, I also enjoy thrifting and reselling clothes as a side business.  </p>
    <p id="abme" class="hidden">I have always enjoyed doing hands on activities and playing sports all throughout my life. In middle school through highschool I played both soccer and basketball. In highschool I began to run indoor track and really began to enjoy running. One interesting fact about me is that I actually ran a sub 5-minute mile during my running career. </p>

    <h2>My Future Career Plans</h2>
    <p>In terms of my future career plans I am not 100% set on a specific job, rather I know the field I want to pursue. As I mentioned earlier, I am pursuing an Environmental Science degree in college. With this being said I know that I want to have a hands on job that works with the environment in some respect. Whether it be an environmental engineer or more of a biologist, I love anything to do with the environment and outdoors.</p>
    <p id="career" class="hidden">I plan on gettin an internship next summer in order to gain some work experience in my future potential workfield, and get a surface idea of what I may want to do specifically. Moreover, this summer, I plan to get some certifications (ie. scuba, etc.) so that my credentials gain more merit and I have a wider skillset to pursue a future career with. All in all I may not know exactly what job position I want to take when I'm older, but I definitely know the direction I want to head towards!</p>
